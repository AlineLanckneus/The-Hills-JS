Type of challenge: *learning* +
Duration: *60 min* +
Team challenge: *solo*


== Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should be able to:

* read a file
* create a file
* create a folder
* move a file
* copy a file
* rename a file
* delete a file
* delete a folder


== Requirements

This briefing assumes that you know how to:

* consult the manual within the terminal


== The mission

You've heard of a bunch of new commands to work with files `cat`, `touch`,
`mkdir`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm` and `rmdir`. Open your *terminal* and *read their
manuals* to understand them, then follow the instructions below.

.Instructions
* create a file named `one.txt`
* type `echo "Hello World" > one.txt`
* print the content of that file on the screen
* create a folder named `story`
* move `one.txt` into that folder
* copy `one.txt` inside the folder `story` as `two.txt`
* print the content of both files
* rename `one.txt` to `part_one.txt` and `two.txt` to `part_two.txt`
* type `echo "I am a junior at BeCode." > story/part_two.txt`
* print the content of both files simultaneously
* remove the folder `story` and all its content

There is two way to remove a folder, try to find both.


== Congrats

You are now able to manage all your files and folders in the command line.
Although it might not be obvious, *the terminal is a very powerful and modern
environment* which will save you lots of time if you're willing to learn how to
use it.
