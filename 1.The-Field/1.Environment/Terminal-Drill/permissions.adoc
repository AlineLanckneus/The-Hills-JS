Type of challenge: *learning* +
Duration: *30 min* +
Team challenge: *solo*


== Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should be able to:

* execute a command as root
* check the permissions of a file
* change the permissions of a file
* change the owner of a file
* change the group of a file


== Requirements

This briefing assumes that you know how to:

* consult the manual within the terminal
* create and read files in the terminal
* list a directory contents


== The mission

You've heard of four new tools to manage permissions and execute commands with
administrative rights `sudo`, `chmod`, `chown` and `chgrp`. Open your *terminal*
and *read their manuals* to understand them, then follow the instructions below.

.Instructions
* create a file
* check the owner and group of the file (use `ls`)
* change its owner to *root*
* change its group to *root*
* check that file's permission (use `ls`)
* give all rights to owner and group, but none to others
* try to print the file on screen
* print the file with root privileges

Permissions and ownership can be tough to grasp but they allow for multiple
people to work on the same system with all their data secured.
