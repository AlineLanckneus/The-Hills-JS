= RTFM - Read the Frickin' Manual

Type of challenge: *learning* +
Duration: *60 min* +
Team Challenge: *solo*


== Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should be able to:

* read the manual of commands
* find out what a command does
* understand the help flag


== The mission

The terminal can be intimidating with all these commands and text flying around.
It's an all new world, one of _textual interface_ with rules very different from
a more familiar _graphical interface_. Hopefully, to guide you in this new
environment there are tools like `man`.

* open a *terminal*
* type `man man`
* hit the `h` key
* leave the manual

You might have guessed it, `man` opens the manual for the wanted page and
although it can be technical it remains one of the best place to learn. Still,
if you simply want a description let's try to use `whatis`.

* type `whatis man`
* type `whatis whatis`

Another great, but more concise, way to understand how to use a command is the
help http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/standard-options.html[flag].

* type `whatis --help`

You won't always find a manual page, but you will usually be able to get
informations via the help flag.

Practice by learning about `ls`, `cp` and `pwd`.


=== Optional

An alternative to the `man` command is `info`. Do some research to learn more
about there differences.


== Congrats

Understanding software is the most important step in using it. For remember, in
the manual lies the *wisdom* and *madness* of the creator.
