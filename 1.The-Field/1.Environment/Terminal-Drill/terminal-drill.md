# Discover the Terminal

Time to discover the terminal and work with the most common commands.

## Goals

You should be able to use the right terminal syntax:

- Move around the file system;
- Show the contents of a folder;
- Create a folder
- Create a file
- Change a filename
- Remove a file

As you'll see, the exercises below give you the objective, but not how to do them. When you don't know, it's time to ask your new BFF: Google! That's one core rule at BeCode : before asking your neighbour for help, ask the internet!

## Deadline

ETA: 3 hours

## The Drill

**All the exercises that follow can only be executed through the terminal !**

To practice, open a Terminal window. Then ...

- Go to your desktop folder
- Check to see if you are in the desktop folder by printing the current directory name
- Create a file `text.txt`
- Open the file in an editor inside the Terminal and write a line of text (the first sentence that comes to mind) and save the file
- Make a folder called `Octocat`
- Go to your new  `Octocat` folder
- Once in your new directory, create the file `yolo.md` in there.
- Open the file and enter your name in it, then save and close it.
- Make a second file, in the same directory, called `readme.md`.
- Write in a little paragraph of text, concerning some of the projects you want to achieve during this training.
- Make a third file in `Octocat`, named after your first and last name with the `.md` extension. In that file write a little text, explaining why you want to be a BeCode Developer
- Remove the file `text.txt`
- List the contents of the `Octocat` directory
- Create the folder `Skills` and create a file `successful.md` in which you write down your computer skills. This can be a list, either with the languages you know or the languages you want to know.
- Create the folder `becode_projects` in which you can store all your future becode files.
- Press the `CRTL+R` keys and see what happens.
- Press the `CRTL+R` keys and type words that you had in your last command and UNIX will find that command for you then just press enter.
