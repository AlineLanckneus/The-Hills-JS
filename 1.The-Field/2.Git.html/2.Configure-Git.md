# Configure Git & GitHub

## Goals

 - Being able to use Git and Github using SSH keys

## Deadline
 - Estimated duration: We'll find out together

## Instructions

### Your profile on Github

Complete your [Github profile](https://github.com/settings/profile).
Your name, surname and a recent picture of yourself are required. 

### Use Github on the terminal (for **Linux**)

To login into github you need a **SSH-key**. 
In the next steps we will see how to generate one and link it to your github account.

#### Generate SSH-key (**Linux**)
1. Open your terminal
2. Copy the following command into your terminal 
    Change "your_email@example.com" to the email address linked to your Github account and press `Enter`.

    ```shell
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

    This will create an SSH key that is linked to your email

3. Generate a private/public RSA key pair
    When you are asked to "Enter a file in which to save the key", press `Enter`. This will accept the standard location.

4. Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/*user_name*/.ssh/id_rsa): [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
5. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
6. Enter same passphrase again: [Leave blank and press `Enter`]
7. Follow this tutorial to add the SSH key to your github account: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/#platform-linux
