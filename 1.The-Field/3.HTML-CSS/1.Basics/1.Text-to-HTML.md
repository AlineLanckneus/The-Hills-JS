# Text to HTML

- Repository: `text-to-HTML`  
 
- Type of Challenge: `Learning`  
  
- Duration: `1 day`  
  
- Deployment strategy : repository on GitHub


## Learning Objectives

Let's turn some *regular old text* in to **HYPER text**!   
After this challenge you should be able to:

- convert plain text to semantic html
- create a webpage with a structured html5 outline
- find documentation on the available html tags
- explain the use of the different html tags
- check your html code with a validator

## The Mission

Convert the article in the [provided text file](./assets/accessible-design.txt) to a valid html document. Your html code should not give any errors when checked by a [validator](https://validator.w3.org). Use the correct html5 elements to section the content.

### Must-have features

- Your html page has a ``title``
- Use the ``article``, ``section`` and ``header`` elements atleast once.
- There is only one ``h1`` element on your page
- List the associated conditions with a ``ul``

### Miscellanous information

There are a lot of [html elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) available, and each one has a specific function. Only use ``div`` as a last resort, as it adds no meaning to the content.

## Deliverables
1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.

### Steps
1. Create the repository both on GitHub and on your pc.
2. Read the provided text file
3. Look up the documentation of the html elements
4. Convert the text file to html
5. Use an online [validator](https://validator.w3.org) to check your code

### Bonus

You finished the challenge, but you're still hungry for more? Awesome! You can expand the challenge by looking up articles on HTML and CSS online. Format the text to valid HTML and add them to your page. 
Don't be affraid to challenge yourself! Add a navigation when you have multiple articles. Add a section with interesting quotes form the articles... 


## Start with good a foundation

There is a reason we start our journey in web development with html. You can find html at the base of every website. Take your time to explore all the different elements and their function.
