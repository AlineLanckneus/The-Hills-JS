# About me

- Repository: `about-me`  
 
- Type of Challenge: `Learning`  
  
- Duration: `1 day`  
  
- Deployment strategy : repository on GitHub


## Learning Objectives

- convert plain text to semantic html
- create a webpage with a structured html5 outline
- find documentation on the available html tags
- explain the use of the different html tags
- check your html code with a validator

## The Mission

You will create a website about your journey in web development. Your website will have at least **2 pages**.
One page where you describe the skills you learned and one page with your contact information (doesn't have to be real).

### Must-have features

- A working navigation
- The same header and footer on each page
- A page with an ``article`` for each skill you acquire (GIT, Command Line, HTML, CSS ...)
- At least one article has an ``img``
- Find of a quote that describes you and add it to your page using the correct tags
- A contact page with a ``form`` to email you
- A favicon 	

### Miscellanous information

There are a lot of [html elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) available, and each one has a specific function. Only use ``div`` as a last resort, as it adds no meaning to the content.

## Deliverables
1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.

### Steps
1. Create the repository both on GitHub and on your pc.
3. Write out the text for your webpage.
4. Convert the text to html
5. Use an online [validator](https://validator.w3.org) to check your code
