# About me

- Repository: `HTML-and-CSS`  
 
- Type of Challenge: `Learning`  
  
- Duration: `1 day`  
  
- Deployment strategy : repository on GitHub


## Learning Objectives

- Use CSS to add styling to a webpage
- Select elements by using different selectors
- Create a readable CSS file with self explanatory names for selectors 
- Removing browser styling by using a CSS reset stylesheet
- **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself! Write DRY CSS
  - If you find yourself repeating yourself a lot, there is probably a better way to structure your CSS

## The Mission

In the previous challenges you have added structure to text by using html tags. Make sure your html code is valid by using a validator, then it's time to add some styling.

### Must-have features

- Use two different fonts on your page
- Add a background to an element
- Increase the font size for the intro of the article
- Use CSS to transform the title to uppercase
- Make your text visually more attractive by using the [correct properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#Font_style_font_weight_text_transform_and_text_decoration)
- All styling is done in the CSS file
- Your CSS selectors describe the content (i.e. ``.title-big`` instead of ``.test2``)

### Miscellanous information

If you have trouble naming your selectors (i.e. ``.column1``, ``.test``, ...) you can make use of CSS naming conventions such as [BEM](http://getbem.com/).

## Deliverables
1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.

### Steps
1. Create a CSS folder in the text-to-html repository
2. Add a reset stylesheet to the CSS folder and link it
3. Look at the difference with and without reset stylesheet
4. Add your own CSS file to the CSS folder and link it
5. Use an online validator to check your code
