# More about me

- Repository: `about-me`  
 
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation`  
  
- Duration: `2 days`  
  
- Deployment strategy : repository on GitHub, hosting on GitHub Pages


## Objectives

- Raise your standards and learn to complete a project so it is 'client ready'.

## Instructions 

You will use your own website/portfolio to apply the skills you learned. The goal of this challenge is to create a completely finished HTML and CSS static page. This is the project where you double check if all your i's are dotted and your t's are crossed. 

> !!! if you feel like you don't have enough content on your website to create a nice looking site, use placeholder text or images for the time being. You can later replace them with meaningful content.

## Assessment

You will do some peer evaluation. Everyone will evaluate one other project using the checklist below.
