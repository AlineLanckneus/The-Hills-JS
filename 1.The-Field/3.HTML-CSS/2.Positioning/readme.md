## Learning Objectives

You now know the specific functions of html and css. One is for structuring the content, the other one styles it. What you see on your screen is the result of both. 

But CSS can do more than just coloring or resizing of elements. Thanks to [CSS flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) or more recently [CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) you can also change the layout of your page. 

The goal of this challenge is to learn how to position elements with flexbox and/or grid.


Try to recreate the following example. 

![](./assets/graph_city.jpg)

The [HTML](./assets/index.html) file for this exercise is provided but without any classes or ids. Try your best to find out what elements need styling and what classnames you will use. Take your time to look at the structure of the html before you write any css. 

Your objectives are:

- Being able to position elements with flexbox and/or grid
- Using the correct terms to explain how you structured your grid or flexbox
