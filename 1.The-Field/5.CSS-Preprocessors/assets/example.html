        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can
            store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the $
            symbol to make something a variable. Here's an example:</p>

        <section>
            <code class="before">
                $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;<br/>
                $primary-color: #333;<br/>
                <br/>
                body {
                font: 100% $font-stack;<br/>
                color: $primary-color;<br/>
                }
            </code>
            <code class="after">
                body {<br/>
                font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;<br/>
                color: #333;<br/>
                }
            </code>
        </section>

        <p>When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the $font-stack and $primary-color and
            outputs normal CSS with our variable values placed in the CSS. This can be extremely powerful when working
            with brand colors and keeping them consistent throughout the site.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Nesting</h2>
        <p>When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other
            hand, doesn't.</p>

        <p>Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be
            aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is
            generally considered bad practice.</p>

        <p>With that in mind, here's an example of some typical styles for a site's navigation:</p>

        <section>
            <code class="before">
                nav {<br/>
                ul {<br/>
                margin: 0;<br/>
                padding: 0;<br/>
                list-style: none;<br/>
                }<br/>
                <br/>
                li { display: inline-block; }<br/>
                <br/>
                a {<br/>
                display: block;<br/>
                padding: 6px 12px;<br/>
                text-decoration: none;<br/>
                }<br/>
                }
            </code>
            <code class="after">
                nav ul {<br/>
                margin: 0;<br/>
                padding: 0;<br/>
                list-style: none;<br/>
                }<br/>
                nav li {<br/>
                display: inline-block;<br/>
                }<br/>
                nav a {<br/>
                display: block;<br/>
                padding: 6px 12px;<br/>
                text-decoration: none;<br/>
                }

            </code>
        </section>

        <p>You'll notice that the ul, li, and a selectors are nested inside the nav selector. This is a great way to
            organize your CSS and make it more readable.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Partials</h2>
        <p>You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass
            files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is
            simply a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like _partial.scss. The
            underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a
            CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @import directive.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Import</h2>
        <p>CSS has an import option that lets you split your CSS into smaller, more maintainable portions. The only
            drawback is that each time you use @import in CSS it creates another HTTP request. Sass builds on top of the
            current CSS @import but instead of requiring an HTTP request, Sass will take the file that you want to
            import and combine it with the file you're importing into so you can serve a single CSS file to the web
            browser.</p>

        <p>Let's say you have a couple of Sass files, _reset.scss and base.scss. We want to import _reset.scss into
            base.scss.</p>

        <section>
            <code class="before">
                // _reset.scss<br/>
                html,<br/>
                body,<br/>
                ul,<br/>
                ol {<br/>
                margin: 0;<br/>
                padding: 0;<br/>
                }<br/>
                <br/>
                // base.scss<br/>
                @import 'reset';<br/>
                body {<br/>
                font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;<br/>
                background-color: #efefef;<br/>
                }

            </code>
            <code class="after">
                html,<br/>
                body,<br/>
                ul,<br/>
                ol {<br/>
                margin: 0;<br/>
                padding: 0;<br/>
                }<br/>
                body {<br/>
                font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;<br/>
                background-color: #efefef;<br/>
                }
            </code>
        </section>

        <p>Notice we're using @import 'reset'; in the base.scss file. When you import a file you don't need to include
            the file extension .scss. Sass is smart and will figure it out for you.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Extend/Inheritance</h2>
        <p>This is one of the most useful features of Sass. Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from
            one selector to another. It helps keep your Sass very DRY. In our example we're going to create a simple
            series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes using another feature which goes hand in hand with
            extend, placeholder classes. A placeholder class is a special type of class that only prints when it is
            extended, and can help keep your compiled CSS neat and clean.</p>
        <section>
            <code>/* This CSS will print because %message-shared is extended. */<br/>
                %message-shared {<br/>
                border: 1px solid #ccc;<br/>
                padding: 10px;<br/>
                color: #333;<br/>
                }<br/>
                <br/>
                // This CSS won't print because %equal-heights is never extended.<br/>
                %equal-heights {<br/>
                display: flex;<br/>
                flex-wrap: wrap;<br/>
                }<br/>
                <br/>
                .message {<br/>
                @extend %message-shared;<br/>
                }<br/>
                <br/>
                .success {<br/>
                @extend %message-shared;<br/>
                border-color: green;<br/>
                }<br/>
                <br/>
                .error {<br/>
                @extend %message-shared;<br/>
                border-color: red;<br/>
                }<br/>
                <br/>
                .warning {<br/>
                @extend %message-shared;<br/>
                border-color: yellow;<br/>
                }
            </code>

            <p>What the above code does is tells .message, .success, .error, and .warning to behave just like
                %message-shared. That means anywhere that %message-shared shows up, .message, .success, .error, &
                .warning will too. The magic happens in the generated CSS, where each of these classes will get the same
                CSS properties as %message-shared. This helps you avoid having to write multiple class names on HTML
                elements.</p>

            <p>You can extend most simple CSS selectors in addition to placeholder classes in Sass, but using
                placeholders is the easiest way to make sure you aren't extending a class that's nested elsewhere in
                your styles, which can result in unintended selectors in your CSS.</p>
            <p>
                Note that the CSS in %equal-heights isn't generated, because %equal-heights is never extended.</p>

        <h2>Operators</h2>
        <p>Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass has a handful of standard math operators like +, -, *, /, and %.
            In our example we're going to do some simple math to calculate widths for an aside & article.</p>

        <section>
            <code class="before">
                .container {<br/>
                width: 100%;<br/>
                }<br/>
                <br/>
                article[role="main"] {<br/>
                float: left;<br/>
                width: 600px / 960px * 100%;<br/>
                }<br/>
                <br/>
                aside[role="complementary"] {<br/>
                float: right;<br/>
                width: 300px / 960px * 100%;<br/>
                }

            </code>
            <code class="after">
                .container {<br/>
                width: 100%;<br/>
                }<br/>
                <br/>
                article[role="main"] {<br/>
                float: left;<br/>
                width: 62.5%;<br/>
                }<br/>
                <br/>
                aside[role="complementary"] {<br/>
                float: right;<br/>
                width: 31.25%;<br/>
                }

            </code>

        <p>We've created a very simple fluid grid, based on 960px. Operations in Sass let us do something like take
            pixel values and convert them to percentages without much hassle.</p>
