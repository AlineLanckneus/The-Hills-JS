# Welcome to css frameworks !

From bootstrap to materialize, the world has lots of css frameworks, but what is a `CSS Framework`?

## The what

A CSS Framework is basically a great library of CSS properties applied to general classes.

you want that grid to be responsive as well. You are propably able to create that, but how long would that take you?
