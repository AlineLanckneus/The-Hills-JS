## Objectives

To conclude our month of HTML and CSS you will create a **finished website** for a real or fictional company or organisation, **in group**. 

You are free to choose what type of company or organisation, but keep it professional. You could, for example, refresh the outdated website of a **charity** or **local youth movement**. Or you can just create **your own company**, complete with logo and products. You can look for inspiration [online](https://onepagelove.com).

Don't have any inspiration and just want to focus on your code? Our resident web designer Kevin has prepared a design for you to use: *(you can ask him for his design files)*

##### Some tips:

- Don't just open your editor and start coding! Do some research first!

- Building a website requires some planning. Think about all the different functionalities your website will need. 

- Think about the design, create a prototype on paper.

- Read the requirements before you start

- Write semantic HTML and keep your CSS functional 

- Did you finish your part of the project? Time to go above and beyond! Add your own requirements to the list

- Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.

- Have fun!


## Instructions 

- Invent a company together and think of four pages that the company needs. *(home, info, about, products, contact,...)*
- Divide those pages amongst the group
- Create the repository `name-of-your-business`
- Choose your GIT strategy
- Decide what technologies you will use (CSS framework ? SASS ?)
- Design your *responsive* page 
- *Optional: once you are all finished, join those pages together into a one page website*
- Publish the result with GitHub Pages
- Make sure everyone in the group has a repository of the website
- Explain your company in the readme of the repo and put a link to the company 'website' in there
