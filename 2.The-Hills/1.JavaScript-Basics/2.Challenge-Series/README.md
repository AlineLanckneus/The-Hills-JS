Welcome to the JavaScript folder.

## Structure

The file consists of 48 exercises, divided into 7 series.  

Don't be afraid of the number: most of these exercises are very short and focus on a particular aspect.  
The exercises follow one another in a logical _relatively_ way, but don't let one exercise stop you: go to the next, come back to it later.

Each exercise must be done.  

**Note:** The exercises in series 7 are a little more complex, worth a try: they are good syntheses of the progress made.

#### Local server

Some exercises may require running the code on a _local server_.  

This is a good practice that should always be applied. I recommend that you install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine, then install [**sèvè**](https://github.com/leny/seve), a small utility that generates a local server from your command line.
