## The Field

### Your Environment

> As a webdeveloper you don't need a lot; a laptop, an internet connection and coffee.
> Your laptop is like your swiss army knife, it contains every tool you need to create something.
> So before we start creating, we should get to know our tools a little better.

### HTML/CSS/GIT

> By now you should be comfortable with your operating system and know how what we mean when we talk about the command line. So let's put that new knowledge to good use.  
> You will be using Git and GitHub for every project from now on. So it is definitely worth spending some time on exploring the technology.
