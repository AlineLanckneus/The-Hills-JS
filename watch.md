# The Watch

The watch is a moment of 10 to 15 minutes, each day after the break, where you give a presentation or live code demo about anything tech related.  

When in doubt if something is suitable for the watch, check with your coach.

## Rules
- 10 to 15 minutes of talking
- 5 minutes of Q/A and feedback
- Can be about anything, but preferably tech related
- Be ready at 13:20 to start
- Start talking at exactly 13:30

## Tips

### Practice
- Practice the beamer at least once
- Practice what you are going to say at least once, preferably with someone listening
  
### Slides/other media
- Use the pointer device so you can advance slides without being at your laptop
- Or have someone else do the slides
- DO NOT USE THE LAPTOP YOURSELF, it makes your presentation 10x worse if you do it yourself because you will be talking down, won't be heard as well, you'll struggle doing things cause of the stress, ...
- So do yourself a favor and ask someone else to handle the switching, playing, slides, ...
  
### Ask questions
- As introduction to new things: 'what do you know about X?'
- To keep people interested: 'but why would they do X like this?'
- To know if they are getting what you are saying: 'Which of these is correct?'
- Write down those questions and think of the possible responses

### Content
- Make a long presentation, then cut stuff that is bad/boring
